# Assignment 05 Rubric

Many ideas and wording are taken from the method of grading put forward in Harvard's CS50 course.

## The Formula

Score = (8 x Correctness) + (8 x Design) + (3 x Style & Best Practice) + Attention to Detail

## Correctness

_"Does your code do what it was asked to do?"_

- 5: All challenges pass.
- 4: Two challenges pass and another passes half the tests.
- 3: One challenge passes and the others pass half their tests.
- 2: One challenge passes at least half the tests and the others pass less than half their tests.
- 1: One or more challenges don't run.
- 0: No tests pass.

## Design

_"How closely does your code approach the design ideals of clarity, efficiency, and maintainability?"_

- 5: Excellent. Essentially no room for improvement.
- 4: Very good. Minor room for improvement.
- 3: Good. Some room for improvement.
- 2: Fair. Ample room for improvement.

- 0: Three or more **types** of style errors detected.

## Attention to Detail
